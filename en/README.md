## Introduction

This work is some notes of learning and practicing data structures and algorithm.

1. Part I is some brief introduction of basic data structures and algorithm, such as, linked lists, stack, queues, trees, sorting and etc.
2. Part II is the analysis and summary of programming problems, and most of the programming problems come from <https://leetcode.com/> and <http://www.lintcode.com/>.
3. Part III is the appendix of resume and other supplements.
